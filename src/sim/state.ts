/**
 * The whole game in one plain, serializable object.
 *
 * `GameState` is data only — no classes, no methods, no references to anything
 * outside itself. Everything it holds survives `JSON.stringify` unchanged
 * (see `snapshotState` in `game.ts`), which is what makes save files, replays,
 * network sync and debugging dumps all the same problem.
 *
 * Determinism
 * -----------
 * The generator is stored *in* the state (`state.rng`), so a roll is a state
 * mutation like any other and two runs of the same command log stay in lockstep.
 * Nothing in the simulation may call `Math.random()` or read the clock.
 *
 * The map is generated from `config.seed` directly, but gameplay must not roll
 * the same numbers the terrain did: `state.rng` is a *separate stream* derived
 * from the same seed through `hashSeed` (see `deriveGameplayRng`). Same seed,
 * same map, uncorrelated gameplay rolls.
 *
 * Entity ids
 * ----------
 * Units and cities are allocated ids from `nextEntityId`, a plain counter, so
 * ids depend only on the order commands were applied — never on insertion order
 * of a Map or the address of an object. Ids are unique across *all* entity
 * kinds, which keeps "selected thing" references unambiguous later.
 *
 * Ordering
 * --------
 * Anything that affects the outcome iterates an array. `players`, `units` and
 * `cities` are arrays and their order is part of the state.
 *
 * Simultaneous turns
 * ------------------
 * There is no "current player". Every player acts inside one shared turn window
 * and the turn resolves when the last of them has ended it, so the only turn
 * state is *who is finished*: `turnEnded`, a boolean per player. That is a set
 * in spirit, but it is an array because a `Set` does not survive
 * `JSON.stringify` and this state has to.
 *
 * Why tile ownership lives here and not on the map
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * `tileOwner` is a parallel array over `map.tiles`, not a field on `Tile`, and
 * that is the point: `GameMap` is *generation output*. It is a pure function of
 * the seed and the size, `newGame` rebuilds it rather than storing it, and
 * `replay` relies on that — a save file carries a seed, not four thousand tiles.
 * The moment a border expansion wrote into a tile, the map would stop being
 * reproducible from its seed and would have to be serialised in full.
 *
 * Keeping it parallel also keeps the fast path fast: ownership changes once or
 * twice per turn per city and is read constantly, so it wants to be a flat array
 * indexed exactly like `map.tiles` (`row * width + col`, via `tileIndex`). It
 * holds *city* ids rather than player ids because a tile belongs to a city — the
 * player is one lookup away and would otherwise be duplicated state that could
 * disagree with itself.
