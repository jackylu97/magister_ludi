# Magister Ludi (repo `magister_ludi`; formerly "WebCiv")

Browser Civ V-style 4X. TypeScript + Vite. Deterministic simulation, procedural
toon-shaded 3D renderer, data-driven balance. Design ledger: `docs/design-notes.md`.
UI design language: `docs/design-specimen.html` (ink/parchment, Instrument Serif /
Fraunces / Instrument Sans / IBM Plex Mono; every number tabular mono).

Naming is settled: "Magister Ludi" is the product name, but internal code may keep
"webciv" in identifiers and domain strings — the RNG separator
`hashSeed('webciv:gameplay:…')` (`src/sim/state.ts`) must NEVER be renamed, as it
would change every seeded outcome. No further rename passes.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run test` (Vitest) · `npm run build`
- All three gates (typecheck, test, build) must be clean before any task is "done".
- Subagents: never commit or push; the orchestrating session handles git.
- Kill only processes you started, by PID. Never `pkill -f vite`.

## Layout
- `src/sim/` — the game rules. PURE: no DOM, no canvas, no `Math.random()`, no clock.
  All randomness via the seeded `Rng` stored in `GameState` (`state.rng`).
- `src/render3d/` — default renderer (Three.js, ortho toon diorama). Procedural
  primitives only; no downloaded/hand-made assets. Tunables in `data/view3d.json`.
- `src/render/` — FROZEN 2D renderers (`?art=sprites`, `?art=flat`). Keep compiling;
  no new features ever.
- `src/ui/` — DOM UI. `controls.ts` drives renderers only through the `MapView`
  interface in `mapView.ts` (optional methods for renderer-specific features).
- `data/*.json` — every balance number, cost, curve, color mapping. Code contains
  algorithms, never tuned constants.
- `test/` — sim + pure-render-math tests. Never drop coverage; reworked tests replace.

## Hard rules
1. Every game mutation flows through `applyCommand` (`src/sim/commands.ts`) or the
   end-of-turn phases it invokes (`src/sim/turn.ts`, fixed order). Commands are plain
   JSON, carry `playerId`, validate FULLY before mutating (rejected command = state
   byte-identical). The reducer's switch uses the aliased-discriminant exhaustiveness
   idiom — do not "simplify" it.
2. Determinism is sacred: same config + command log ⇒ bit-identical state. Saves are
   `{config, log}` and replay. Iterate arrays, never Map/Set order, for outcomes.
   Contention (simultaneous turns) resolves by log/sweep order.
3. Turn model is SIMULTANEOUS: per-player `turnEnded` flags; resolution when all end.
   There is no `currentPlayerIndex`. UI gates input to `localPlayerId` (UI concept,
   not a sim concept).
4. Rendering must not touch sim randomness — visual jitter hashes tile coords
   (`hash3`/`hashUnit`).
5. Docblock-style comments explaining *why*, matching existing files' voice.

## Known traps
- `MeshToonMaterial` silently ignores `flatShading` — bake facets into geometry.
- Fog is unusable with the ortho camera.
- Piece visuals rebuild off a fingerprint of `(id, col, row, hp, ownerId)` — any new
  visual-affecting unit property must be added to the fingerprint.
- `turnEnded` assumes player id === array index; revisit if players become removable.
- City-panel yields are derived state refreshed in `collectYields`; mutations outside
  the turn pipeline show stale numbers until end of turn.

## Direction (see docs/design-notes.md for full ledger)
- Vanilla Civ mechanics first; deckbuilding civics / happiness+authority / events
  are specced but deliberately later. Do not build parked ideas.
- Single-player-vs-AI + remote multiplayer are the product; hot-seat seat-switching
  is a dev harness only. Netcode after playable core + AI.
- Everything visual is placeholder to be dialed later; art direction and palette are
  settled (toon diorama + specimen language).
