/**
 * **The bot appraisal batch of 2026-09-04** (`docs/flags.md`, "bot appraisal
 * batch — routes · great people · tile lines").
 *
 * Three things the seat used to price at nothing, or at a position in a list,
 * and each of them is asked here of the pure function that holds it rather than
 * of a played game — `aiWar.test.ts`' bench, for its reason: every claim below
 * is about *one decision on a board somebody arranged*, and a generated map
 * would arrange it differently every time the mapgen is tuned.
 *
 *   · **the route scorer** — one table over own and foreign partners, priced by
 *     the simulation's own route folds. The pin is a mirror: the *same* three
 *     towns, one board where the crossing pays more and one where the origin's
 *     shelves do, and the seat takes whichever is worth more. Greed, not a
 *     preference either way;
 *   · **a work's second-order gifts** — the seam it opens under itself and the
 *     defender line a citadel plants, the latter off a knob in `data/ai.json`
 *     rather than a number in the code;
 *   · **the ghost's tile lines** — `cityYields(state, city, [lighthouse])` now
 *     sees the coastal food, which is the whole worth of that row, and a real
 *     reading is untouched.
